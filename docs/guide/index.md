The guide contains these sections:

* [Tensors and Operations](tensors_operations.md) —An intro to tensors, data, shapes
  and data types, the building blocks of TensorFlow.js
* [Platform & Environment](platform_environment.md) —Overview of the different
  platforms and environments in TensorFlow.js and the tradeoffs between them.
* [Models and Layers](models_and_layers.md) —How to build a model in
  TensorFlow.js using the Layers and the Core API.
* [Training Models](train_models.md) —Introduction to training: models,
  optimizers, losses, metrics, variables.
* [Saving and Loading Models](save_load.md) —Learn how to save and load
  TensorFlow.js models.
* [Model Conversion](conversion.md) —See the landscape of model types available
  in the TensorFlow.js ecosystem and the details behind conversion of models.
* [Differences from Python tf.keras](layers_for_keras_users.md) —Know the major
  differences and capabilities between TensorFlow.js and Python `tf.keras` and
  the API conventions used in JavaScript.
* [Using TensorFlow.js in Node.js](nodejs.md) —Understand the tradeoffs between
  the three available Node.js bindings and the system requirements they have.
