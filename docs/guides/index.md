# Intro to TF.js Guide

Welcome to the guide!

The _guide_ is a document with a description of high-level concepts important to TensorFlow.js. Unlike tutorials, sections of the guide are not specific to a given task, but should give you a good sense of the TensorFlow.js ecosystem and its major conventions and concepts.

Other resources available include:

*   [Tutorials](../tutorials/index) that are built around a specific task on various topics.
*   [API docs](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/) provide documentation and code samples you can run right in the page.
*   [Models repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models), a collection of off-the-shelf models that don't require knowledge of tensors.
*   [Code examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples) that implement various ML tasks using TensorFlow.js.

The guide is broken into various sections as described below:

[**Tensors & Operations.**](tensors-operations) An intro to tensors, data, shapes and data types, the building blocks of TensorFlow.js

[**Platforms & Environments.**](platforms-environments) Overview of the different platforms and environments in TensorFlow.js and the tradeoffs between them.

[**Models and Layers.**](models-and-layers) How to build a model in TensorFlow.js using the Layers and the Core API.

[**Training Models.**](training-models) Introduction to training: models, optimizers, losses, metrics, variables.

**Model Conversion.** See the landscape of model types available in the TensorFlow.js ecosystem and the details behind conversion of models.

**Differences from Python tf.keras.** Know the major differences and capabilities between TensorFlow.js and Python tf.keras and the API conventions used in JavaScript.

[**Using TensorFlow.js in Node.js.**](using-tfjs-in-node) Understand the tradeoffs between the three available Node.js bindings and the system requirements they have.

**Visualizing Model Behavior.** Overview of tfjs-vis library and the different visualization options: in-browser and interfacing with [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard).
