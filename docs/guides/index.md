# Intro to TF.js Guide

Welcome to the guide!

The _guide_ is a document with a description of high-level concepts important to TensorFlow.js. Unlike tutorials, sections of the guide are not specific to a given task, but should give you a good sense of the TensorFlow.js ecosystem and its major conventions and concepts.

Other resources available include:

*   Tutorials that are built around a specific task on various topics.
*   Our API docs provide documentation and code samples you can run right in the page.
*   Our models repo, a collection of off-the-shelf models that don't require knowledge of tensors.
*   See our code examples that implement various ML tasks using TensorFlow.js.

The guide is broken into various sections as described below:

**Tensors & Operations.** An intro to tensors, data, shapes and data types, the building blocks of TensorFlow.js

**Backends & Environments.** Overview of the different backends and environments in TensorFlow.js and the tradeoffs between them.

[**Models and Layers.**](models-and-layers) How to build a model in TensorFlow.js using the Layers and the Core API.

[**Training Models.**](training-models) Introduction to training: models, optimizers, losses, metrics, variables.

**Model Conversion.** See the landscape of model types available in the TensorFlow.js ecosystem and the details behind conversion of models.

**Differences from Python tf.keras.** Know the major differences and capabilities between TensorFlow.js and Python tf.keras and the API conventions used in JavaScript.

**Choosing between Node and the Browser.** Tradeoffs of working in Node vs browser environments.

**Choosing the right Node.js binding.** Understand the tradeoffs between the three available Node.js bindings and the system requirements they have.

**Visualizing Model Behavior.** Overview of tfjs-vis library and the different visualization options: in-browser and interfacing with [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard).
