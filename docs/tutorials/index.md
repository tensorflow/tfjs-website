# Get Started

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript Library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and in Node.js.

See the sections below for different ways you can get started.


## Code ML programs without dealing directly with Tensors

Want to get started with Machine Learning but not worry about any low level details like Tensors or Optimizers?

Built on top of TensorFlow.js, the ml5.js library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser with a concise, approachable API.

## Get Setup with TensorFlow.js

Comforable with concepts like Tensors, Layers, Optimizers and Loss Functions (or willing to get comfortable with them)? TensorFlow.js provides flexible building blocks for neural network programming in JavaScript.

See how to get up and running with TensorFlow.js code in the browser or Node.js.
