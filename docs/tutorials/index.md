# Get started

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the web browser and in Node.js.

This page lists some ways to get started with TensorFlow.js.


## Code ML programs without dealing directly with tensors

If you want to get started with machine learning without managing optimizers or tensor manipulation, then check out the ml5.js library.

Built on top of TensorFlow.js, the ml5.js library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the web browser with a concise, approachable API.
