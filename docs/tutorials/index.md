# Get Started

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript Library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and in Node.js.

See the sections below for different ways you can get started.

## New To Machine Learning?


Want to get started with Machine Learning but not worry about any low level details like Tensors or Optimizers? Check out these high level coding APIs and learning resources.

### Do you want to code ML programs without dealing directly with Tensors?
