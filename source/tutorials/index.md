# Tutorials

<h2><a href="./core-concepts.html">Core Concepts in TensorFlow.js</a></h2>

Learn about core concepts in TensorFlow.js such tensors, operations, models, layers and training.
Also learn a few useful tips about memory management and writing "tidy" code.

<h2><a href="./fit-curve.html">Training First Steps: Fitting a Curve to Synthetic Data</a></h2>

In this tutorial we will build a small toy model completely from scratch using TensorFlow.js operations. We will fit a curve to some synthetic data that we generate using a polynomial function.

<h2><a href="./mnist.html">Training on images — Recognizing Handwritten Digits with a Convolutional Neural Network</a></h2>

In this tutorial we will build a convolutional neural network to recognize
handwritten digits in images (MNIST). We will use the TensorFlow.js layers API
to construct, train, and evaluate the model.
