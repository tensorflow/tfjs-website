# Tutorials
<h2><a href="./core-concepts.html">Core Concepts in TensorFlow.js</a></h2>

Learn about core concepts in TensorFlow.js such as tensors, operations, models, layers and training.
Also learn a few useful tips about memory management and writing "tidy" code.

<h2><a href="./fit-curve.html">Training First Steps: Fitting a Curve to Synthetic Data</a></h2>

This tutorial demonstrates building a small toy model completely from scratch using TensorFlow.js operations. We will fit a curve to some synthetic data that we generate using a polynomial function.

<h2><a href="./mnist.html">Training on images — Recognizing Handwritten Digits with a Convolutional Neural Network</a></h2>

This tutorial shows how to build a convolutional neural network to recognize
handwritten digits in images (MNIST). We will use the TensorFlow.js layers API
to construct, train, and evaluate the model.

<h2><a href="./webcam-transfer-learning.html">Transfer learning - Train a neural network to predict from webcam data</a></h2>

This tutorial explains how to train a neural network to make predictions from
webcam data. We'll use those predictions to play [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man)!

<h2><a href="./import-keras.html">How to import a Keras Model into TensorFlow.js</a></h2>

This tutorial explains how to convert and serve an existing Keras model to run in the browser.

<h2><a href="./model-save-load.html">Saving and Loading tf.Model</a></h2>

This tutorial explains how to save `tf.Model`s to various destinations such as the web browser's Local Storage and load them back.

<h2><a href="./mnist-node.html">Running under Node.js</a></h2>

This tutorial explains how to train a convolutional neural network in Node.js using the MNIST dataset. We'll show how to install the TensorFlow
backend and use Node.js APIs for downloading and loading training data.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-converter" target="_blank">How to import a TensorFlow SavedModel into TensorFlow.js</a></h2>

__Developer Preview:__ This tutorial explains how to convert and serve an existing TensorFlow SavedModel to run in the browser.

# Guides
<h2><a href="./tfjs-layers-for-keras-users.html">TensorFlow.js Layers API for Keras Users</a></h2>

This guide explains the similarities and differences between the Layers API
of TensorFlow.js and [Keras](https://keras.io/).
